# Command used to run the program
*This is all done in the command line*

first for the pdf_text1.txt

`python mr_word_count.py pdf_text1.txt >> first_text_output.txt`

second for pdf_text2.txt

`python non_english_counter.py pdf_text2.txt >> second_text_output.txt`

I then opened the output files in notepad and saved them as pdf using the print function and saving as a pdf.
