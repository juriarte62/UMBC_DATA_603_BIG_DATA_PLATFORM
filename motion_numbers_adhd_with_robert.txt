here is an example command
                                                                                       | <- all this crap you just need because that's how you need to do things in matlab 
check_twins_motion('/home/groups/brainmri/adhd_asd/data/adhd_motion_all.conc',2.3,21, [], 1)
                    | path to conc file                                         |  |                                                                                
                                                                                |   21 -> FD = 0.2 
                                                                                |   31 -> FD = 0.3 
                                                                                |
                                                                                This will 
                                                                                change depending on the
                                                                                repititions time of the
                                                                                noted in the .json  
                                                        
when you execut ethe code in matlab 
it will save all this information as a variable in matlab 
you'lll have to keep dealijng with this thing
when this finishes, check on the workspace on the right as an array 
you can turn this into a xl sheet if you want
