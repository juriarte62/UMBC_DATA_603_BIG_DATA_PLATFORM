BCP notes 3/27 

issues we've been having 

1) permission errors that are preventing kahty and I from processing since luci, and I were the ones who were
2) bad nodes, even though they usually don't give us much probalems like before
-----> then I have to dig in and figure out which subs are still processing and which ones failed 

use this code 

for JOB in $( squeue -u uriartel | awk ' {print $1} ' ); do scontrol show jobid -dd $JOB | grep Command ; done
